  # I'm sorry. I do have problems with cancan's terminology, here.
  # For me, the User can do something, i.e. I would ask 
  #
  #   @user.can? :manage, @page

  # But for cancan, it's 
  #
  #   Ability.new(@user).can? :manage, @page
  #
  # That is why I let(:the_user) be the ability.
  # Also note, "he" refers to the regular "it" call.
  # I just like to call the user "he" rather than "it".
